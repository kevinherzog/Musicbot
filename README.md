# Musicbot

Hey,
I am making this Musicbot for everyone free to use on their own server. At first it will be a very simple one but I plan to expand on this idea. So if you have any ideas, hit me up, if it is plausible I will try to implement it.

I use node, discord.js and ytdl. I will try to implement Spotify and soundcloud in near future.

Have fun with it!

Friendly regards,
Kevin :)
